This repository contains the components of the DISP Portfolio. Proof of the deployed process can be found as "Deployment_evidence.PNG" in the portfolio.

JUnit Testing
The test for the deployed process.bpmn was meant to track the flow of the process through the first gateway via random boolean assignments, along with printing useful information, such as what the boolean values were for the gateway at the time of the test. A token should sucessfully reach the next task from either direction through the first gateway.
